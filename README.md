# Lars' dotfiles

My personal dotfiles grown over the years. Created for MacOS Big Sur. Inspired by a lot of awesome dotfiles out there. Currently running with Bash and Terminal.

**Don't just install this without reviewing and adjusting this to your needs! This is strongly opinionated and suited to my own needs.**

## Installation

To get started clone the dotfiles anywhere you like. `cd` into it and execute the bootstrap script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lgraubner/dotfiles.git && ./dotfiles/bootstrap
```

This will install all needed programs and copies the dotfiles into your home directory.
